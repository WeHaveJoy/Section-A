# SECTION B

#### The project that I'm most proud of:
I am particularly proud of one project in particular, the most recent one I completed, called "computer_literacy," though I am happy of all of my work. I used javascript to code it, and it has a front end and a back end. I set it up on github pages and heroku. As Heroku is currently not free, the back-end portion does not function when you run it on Github Pages. I worked on the database and APIs that connected the front-end and the back-end of the group project.

you can find it on my github account on the following link: https://github.com/WeHaveJoy/computer_literacy.git
